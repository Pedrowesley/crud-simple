# CrudSimple

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

## Step to run
### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm run start
```
The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `4200`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm run db` - runs the **JSON Server** with execution **parameters** in  `package.json`.
* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
